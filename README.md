# InkSpire ðŸ–‹

My first-ever React app, InkSpire ðŸ–‹, with Appwrite as the backend. InkSpire is a forum that collects articles from writers and displays them to its users. Writers can manage their own collection of articles as well as pieces written by others. InkSpire also handles the authentication process and presents the product in a polished and subtle form.
