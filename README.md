# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
- I have built and deployed my first-ever React app, InkSpire ðŸ–‹, with Appwrite as the backend.
InkSpire is a forum that collects articles from writers and displays them to its users. Writers can manage their own collection of articles as well as pieces written by others. InkSpire also handles the authentication process and presents the product in a polished and subtle form.
-> Tech Stack
- Backend Service: Appwrite
- Frontend: React JS + Tailwind
 -- State Management: React Redux and Redux Toolkit (RTK)
 -- Real-time Text Editor: TinyMCE
 -- Routing: React Router DOM
 -- Forms/Data Collection: React Hook Form
 -- HTML Parser: HTML React Parser
  
-PS:
-There is a slight chance that you might encounter some issues with the live app, as it's my first deployed project, but please do check it out!
